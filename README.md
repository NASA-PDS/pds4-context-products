# PDS4 Context Product Management
Repository for managing PDS4 Context Products across all internationally-managed, PDS4 context products.

## Overview
Per IPDA Steering Committee meeting in September 2024, a need was identified for more clear transparency and communication with regard to current and future context products being used across the system in order to avoid duplication, and encourage best practices and collaboration.

## Governance
With most context products originating from a parent investigation, the lead agency of an investigation governs over the context products that fall under that investigation. Creation and management of context products related to an investigation can be delegated to other affilliated agencies through collaboration and discussion.

For context products that do no originate from an investigation (e.g. a target context product), the agency who identifies and creates the context products will gain ownership over that context product.
